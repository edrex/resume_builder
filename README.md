Generate pixel-perfect HTML and PDF resumes with Markdown. Feel free to adapt for your own use.

Have a look at the Makefile to get started.

## Requirements

* pandoc (for Markdown -> HTML) looking at replacing with standard markdown.
* a statically linked build of wkhtmltopdf in the current directory. The version in Ubuntu Maverick is missing the ability to preserve hyperlinks in PDFs.
